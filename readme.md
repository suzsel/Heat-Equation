# Numerical Heat Equation Solver
This is my implementation of numerical solving for the heat equation.
## Run
```console 
python HeatEquation.py
```

```console
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -l L        boundary condition for left side of the plate
  -t T        boundary condition for top side of the plate
  -r R        boundary condition for right side of the plate
  -b B        boundary condition for bottom side of the plate
  -d D        mm^2 / sec (aluminium - default)
  -len LEN    mm
  -wid WID    mm
  -tm TM      seconds
  -n N        nodes
